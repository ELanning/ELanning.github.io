# Greetings!

Welcome to my hideously tacky personal site. It is not mobile friendly. It is not minimal.

Engineers have a proclivity for minimalism. Probably because Google has a proclivity for minimalism, as does Apple.
There is nothing wrong with this, and it has many advantages. I have been to countless sites of many talented Software Developers.
They all look great, are readable, and simple. They feature fun to read experiences of the hot new technologies.
 Yet, truthfully, most are utterly forgettable.
 This site is not any of that. It is not easy to read the posts, especially on mobile, because of the clunky UI.
 However, my face punching site is _possibly_ memorable, and that's really all I'm aiming for.
 I want to be that guy with the terrible Windows 95 theme, who posts archaic stuff that no one has time to read, and really, even if they did, they wouldn't be doing it on such an ugly site.

Thank you,

p.s.
Why didn't I use me@eriklanning.com? Maybe someday I'll set that up.
